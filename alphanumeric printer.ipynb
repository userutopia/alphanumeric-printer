    """
    The code seperates the string into digits, alphabets and the indices of the digits.
    It works on the premise that if the index of the digit under consideration is one more than the index of the digit
    before it , the digits are printed together until a digit comes along that does not meet the condition. When that happens,
    a comma is introduced and the loop continues.
    After, the list of alphabets and final(which contains the list of the sorted digits) are zipped together.
